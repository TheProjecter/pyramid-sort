# Pyramid sort #
A very simple algorithm that does sorting of n elements in O(n^2) time (still faster than bubble sort from 2 to 4 times). The implementation of the algorithm is very simple but a bit harder to understand than conventional algorithms (bubblesort, insertion\_sort etc.).

The particularity of this algorithm is that internally need to use a "BubbleSort". But despite that it is faster than BubbleSort.
